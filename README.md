#Project Euler

###Description

[ProjectEuler](http://www.projecteuler.net) is a website that holds a large set of mathematical and computational problems dealing with massive data sets that require clever programming solutions to solve.

###List of Problems (title):

1. Multiples of 3 and 5
1. Even Fibbonacci numbers
1. Largest prime factor
1. Largest palindrome product
1. Smallest multiple
1. Sum of square difference
1. 10001st prime
1. Largest product in a series
1. Special Pythagorean triplet
1. Summation of primes
1. Largest product in a grid
1. Highly divisible triangular number
1. Large sum
1. Longest Collatz sequence
1. Lattice paths
1. Power digit sum
1. Number letter counts
1. Maximum path sum I
1. Counting Sundays
1. Factorial digit sum
1. Amicable numbers
1. Names scores


###Note

Project Euler asks for the numerical answer for each problem, which means that their is only one solution per question. However, I've some or several of my solutions allow the user to input any number. This means that my solutions above allow you to solve a specific type of problem for any given value(s).
